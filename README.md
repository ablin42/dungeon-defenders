# Dungeon Defenders üõ°Ô∏è

### Defend your dungeon. Level up your army. Boast your loot.

## Overview

Dungeon Defenders is a dungeon crawler where you explore procedurally generated dungeons, fight monsters, collect loot, and level up your character. Your character and loot live entirely on-chain while the gameplay happens off-chain. Your character will evolve as they increase levels and retrieve loot; this evolution will be reflected on-chain.

## Tokens

### Characters

Characters will be evolutive ERC721 token. The NFT will contain the attributes of the character, their species, their levels, their win/loss ratio. Things that happen in the dungeon will be reflected on the character‚Äôs NFT.

### Gems

Gems are an ERC20 token. Gems are the most common loot that you will receive for defending a dungeon. Gems can be used to buy characters, weapons, or level up your character. Gems can be transferred, or sold, to other players.

### Loot

Loot will be an ERC721 token. Loot the player wants in the dungeon will need to be staked along with the character nft upon entering the dungeon. Loot will give in-game attribute increases.

## Mechanics

The gameplay will happen off-chain on our website (dungeondefenders.xyz). To enter the dungeon, a player must pay gems and stake their character and loot NFTs. While staked, that NFTs cannot be used to do anything else (i.e. cannot be transferred nor enter another dungeon). The result of the dungeon is then committed to the chain.

### Victory

When the player beats a dungeon their character NFT will receive experience that works towards leveling up their character, the player will receive gems, and possibly receive additional loot.

### Loss

The contract can be unstaked for no rewards. You will lose the gems you paid to enter.
