# Dungeon Defenders ⚔️🛡️

### Defend your dungeon. Level up your army. Boast your loot.

Dungeon Defenders is a **dungeon crawler** where you explore procedurally generated dungeons, fight monsters, collect loot, and level up your character. Your character and loot live entirely **on-chain** while the gameplay happens off-chain. Your character will evolve as they increase levels and retrieve loot; this evolution will be reflected on-chain.

## Game Cycle

    1. 💎 Claim *GEMS* from faucet

    3. 🎁 Stake your *defender*, defend the dungeon, win rewards
    4. 🥋 Equip your newly found items / Sell your *GEMS*

## Tokens

### Defenders ⚔️

Characters will be evolutive _ERC721_ token. The _NFT_ will contain the attributes of the character, their species, their levels, their win/loss ratio. Things that happen in the dungeon will be reflected on the _character’s NFT_.

### Gems 💎

_Gems_ are an _ERC20_ token. Gems are the most _common loot_ that you will receive for defending a dungeon. Gems can be used to buy characters, weapons, or level up your character. _Gems can be transferred, or sold, to other players._

### Loot 🥋

_LOOT_ is an _ERC721 token_. Loot the player wins in the dungeon will need to be _staked_ along with the _character NFT_ upon entering the dungeon. _LOOT_ will give _in-game attribute increases._

## Mechanics ⚙️

The gameplay will happen _off-chain_ on our website (dungeondefenders.xyz). To enter the dungeon, a player must pay gems and stake their character and loot _NFTs._ While staked, that NFTs cannot be used to do anything else (i.e. cannot be transferred nor enter another dungeon). _The result of the dungeon is then committed to the chain._

### Victory 🏆

When the player beats a dungeon their character NFT will receive _experience_ that works towards leveling up their character, the player will receive _GEMS_, and possibly receive additional _LOOT_

### Loss ☠️

The _NFTs_ can be unstaked for no rewards. You will _lose the GEMS_ you paid to enter.
